# Librarian - Personal Book Catalog

A powerful desktop application for cataloging and managing your personal PDF book collection on macOS.

## Features

### Core Features
- 📚 **PDF Discovery & Import** - Automatically scan and import PDFs from your Books folder
- 🔍 **Smart Search** - Search by title, author, or content
- 🏷️ **Tagging System** - Organize books with custom tags and categories
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support** - Built for Russian and English books with automatic language detection
- 🖥️ **Native Desktop App** - Electron-based macOS application
- 🔒 **100% Offline** - All data stays on your machine
- 🆓 **Completely Free** - Open source, no subscriptions or API costs

### Local AI (no API keys, works offline)

Everything AI runs on your own machine through [Ollama](https://ollama.com).
There is no account, no per-token cost, and nothing leaves the laptop.

- 🏷️ **Automatic tagging** — books are tagged by subject as they arrive, from a
  controlled vocabulary so the tag filter stays usable
- 💬 **Ask a book** — questions answered from that book's own pages, with the
  pages cited, and an honest "not answered by this book" when it isn't
- 🔎 **Ask the library** — "russian books about business added recently" sets
  the filters it means, so you can see and adjust the interpretation
- 📖 **Compare across books** — "how do my books explain gradient descent?"
  puts one passage from each book that teaches it side by side, with the page
  numbers, so you can see which treatment suits you before opening anything
- 📚 **Smart collections** — shelves proposed from what your library actually
  contains
- 📝 **Summaries** and **metadata repair** — run-together filenames turned back
  into titles, missing authors read off the front matter
- 🧠 **Semantic search** over local embeddings

Setup:

```bash
brew install ollama && ollama serve
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

Without Ollama the app still runs; AI features report that it is unavailable
and tagging falls back to keyword matching.

### Advanced Features (NEW!)
- 🖼️ **PDF Thumbnails** - Automatic generation of book cover thumbnails from PDF first pages
- 📖 **Quick Open** - Double-click any book to open it directly in your default PDF reader
- 🔍 **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by:
  - Multiple tags (AND logic)
  - Authors
  - Languages (Russian, English, etc.)
  - File types (PDF, EPUB, etc.)
  - Combined with search
- 📊 **Sorting Options** - Sort your library by:
  - Title (A-Z or Z-A)
  - Author name
  - Date added
  - File size
- 📝 **Book Metadata Editor** - Edit title, author, and manage tags directly in the app
- 🎯 **Sticky Navigation** - Header and filter bars stay visible while scrolling
- 🚀 **Batch Processing** - Process metadata for multiple books at once
- 📸 **Batch Thumbnail Generation** - Generate covers for all books with one click
- 🏷️ **Auto-Tagging Suggestions** - Intelligent tag recommendations based on book content and metadata analysis (~200+ keywords)
- 🔍 **Duplicate Detection** - Find and merge duplicate books using advanced string similarity algorithms (Levenshtein distance)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Desktop**: Electron 28
- **Backend**: Express.js + Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **PDF Processing**:
  - pdf-parse (metadata extraction)
  - Tesseract.js (OCR for scanned PDFs)
  - pdf2pic + GraphicsMagick (thumbnail generation)
- **Build System**: GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ LTS
- npm or yarn
- macOS (primary target platform)
- GraphicsMagick (for thumbnail generation)
  ```bash
  brew install graphicsmagick
  ```
- Ghostscript (for PDF processing)
  ```bash
  brew install ghostscript
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bibliotheka.git
cd Bibliotheka
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your Books folder path:
Edit `server/routes/scan.js` line 8:
```javascript
const BOOKS_FOLDER = '/path/to/your/Books';
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

Or run components separately:
```bash
npm run server       # Backend API (port 3001)
npm run react:start  # Frontend (port 5173)
npm run electron:dev # Electron app
```

## Testing against a copy of your library

Anything that deletes or merges books should be tried against a copy, not the
library itself.

```bash
npm run db:test        # 60-book sample copied from the live database
npm run db:test:full   # or the whole thing
npm run db:status      # what each database currently holds
npm run server:test    # run the API against the copy
```

The server prints which database it opened on startup, and background tasks
(scanning, tagging, thumbnails) switch off automatically against a non-default
database — otherwise the scanner would re-import every file and turn the sample
back into the full library. Set `BACKGROUND_TASKS=on` if you want them.

`DATABASE_PATH` selects the file, relative to the project root:

```bash
DATABASE_PATH=./data/test.librarian.db node server/index.js
```

Re-run `npm run db:test` at any point to throw the copy away and start again.
