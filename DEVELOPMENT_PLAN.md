  - [x] Using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (384-dim vectors, runs locally)
  - [x] Created `server/services/embeddingService.js`
  - [x] Lazy model loading (load on first use, keep in memory)
  - [x] Content hashing for change detection (SHA-256)
- [x] **Database Schema**

- [x] **Embedding Pipeline**
  - [x] Batch embedding via `/api/search/embeddings/generate`
  - [x] Single book embedding via `/api/search/embeddings/book/:id`
  - [x] All 445 books embedded in <30 seconds
  - [x] Content hash-based cache to avoid redundant embeddings
- [x] **Semantic Search API** (`server/routes/semanticSearch.js`)
  - [x] `GET /api/search/semantic?q=` — pure semantic search
  - [x] `GET /api/search/hybrid?q=` — combined FTS5 + semantic
  - [x] `GET /api/search/similar/:bookId` — find similar books
  - [x] `GET /api/search/embeddings/stats` — embedding coverage stats
  - [x] Hybrid ranking: FTS5 (0.4 weight) + cosine similarity (0.6 weight)
- [x] **UI Integration**

  - [x] Match type badges (semantic, keyword, both) on search results
  - [x] Similarity percentage on each result
  - [x] "Similar Books" section in BookDetailModal (top 5)
  - [x] Embedding stats in search tips panel

### Phase 14: AI-Powered Summaries ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **Summary Service** (`server/services/summaryService.js`)
  - [x] Three-tier summarization strategy:
    - Single-pass: books under 50K tokens sent directly to Claude
    - Map-reduce: 50K-180K tokens, chunk → summarize → synthesize
    - Sampled: 180K+ tokens, sample beginning/middle/end
  - [x] Extractive fallback when no API key (extracts opening + conclusion)
  - [x] Content hashing for cache invalidation
  - [x] Rate limiting (10/min, 100/hr)
- [x] **Database Schema**
  - [x] `book_summaries` table with summary, summary_short, strategy, model tracking
  - [x] Auto-created on server startup
- [x] **Summary API** (`server/routes/summaries.js`)
  - [x] `GET /api/summaries/:bookId` — get cached summary
  - [x] `POST /api/summaries/:bookId/generate` — generate summary
  - [x] `DELETE /api/summaries/:bookId` — clear cached summary

- [x] **Configuration**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SUMMARY_MODEL` in `.env`

### Phase 15: Local AI and Correctness ✅ COMPLETE

Everything AI now runs on the user's own machine through Ollama. There are no
API keys, no per-token cost, and the app works with no network. `gemma3:4b`
does the work at roughly 400ms per book; `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` acts as a second
opinion where one is worth having.

- [x] **Ollama client** (`server/services/ollamaClient.js`)
  - [x] Schema-constrained JSON, so replies parse without coaxing
  - [x] Degrades to null rather than throwing when Ollama is not running
  - [x] Availability cached for a minute
- [x] **Automatic subject tagging**
  - [x] 83-tag controlled vocabulary fitted to this library
  - [x] Each tag carries a gloss, which is what stops "networking" landing on
        a book about business contacts
  - [x] Membership enforced after the fact — models invent tags regardless
  - [x] Background sweep tags new books without being asked
  - [x] 797/829 books tagged; the remainder have unusable titles
- [x] **Ask a book questions** (`server/services/bookQA.js`)
  - [x] Retrieval over the existing page index, answered locally
  - [x] Cites the pages used, filtered to pages actually retrieved
  - [x] Says when the book does not answer the question
- [x] **Ask the library in plain language** (`server/services/queryInterpreter.js`)
  - [x] "russian books about business" sets the filters it means
  - [x] Returns a filter, not a ranking, so it stays visible and undoable
- [x] **Smart collections** — shelves proposed from the tag distribution
- [x] **Summaries moved off the paid API**; `@anthropic-ai/sdk` removed

**Metadata repair with the model**

- [x] 66 run-together titles restored — `architectingpowerbisolutionsinmicrosoftfabric`
      to `Architecting Power BI Solutions in Microsoft Fabric`
- [x] 57 authors read off front matter
- [x] Guarded by letter-for-letter comparison and a second model's agreement;
      34 were left alone because the answer did not pass

**Correctness**

- [x] Saving a book no longer fails and wipes its tags (names sent where ids
      were expected; the update was not transactional)
- [x] Merging duplicates reports what it did and refreshes the library
- [x] Failures behind every button are surfaced — 16 handlers had an empty
      failure path, which looks exactly like a success that did nothing
- [x] Filter selections no longer drift when the option list changes
- [x] The tagging sweep no longer re-processes books it cannot classify

**Groundwork**

- [x] `DATABASE_PATH` is honoured, so destructive work can run against a copy
- [x] `npm run db:test` makes a trimmed, throwaway copy
- [x] Background tasks default to off against a non-default database
- [x] Stored schema repaired — a migration had written double-quoted string
      literals, which meant VACUUM failed on the database entirely

## Changelog

### 2026-09-08 - Phase 15 - Local AI and Correctness

- **All AI moved to Ollama.** Tagging, summaries, metadata repair, question
  answering and query interpretation run locally. `@anthropic-ai/sdk` removed
  and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` dropped from configuration.
- **Automatic tagging** against an 83-tag controlled vocabulary, with a
  background sweep. 797/829 books tagged across 82 tags.
- **Ask a book questions** over the 108,999-page index, with citations and an
  explicit "not answered by this book".
- **Plain-language search** that sets the filter bar rather than returning an
  opaque ranking.
- **Smart collections** proposed from the library's own tag distribution.
- **Metadata repair**: 66 titles and 57 authors recovered by the local model,
  each guarded and 34 rejected; earlier passes cleared boilerplate from
  publisher, edition and description, leaving none.
- **Embeddings backfilled** — semantic search had been blind to 385 books.
- **A "Recently Added" view**, grouped by day, with an unseen count.
- **Interface rebuilt** on a semantic colour system that works in both themes;
  cards, toolbar, filters, sidebar and every modal.
- **Blocking alerts replaced** with inline status.
- **Correctness pass**: saving a book, merging duplicates, filter selection
  drift, the tagging sweep's retry loop, and 16 silent failure paths.
- **Test database tooling** so destructive work never runs against the library.
- **Stored schema repaired**; VACUUM works again.
